# Description


In this lab, I performed various tasks related to Git and command-line interface (CLI) commands. Here's a summary of what I did and the key takeaways from the lab:

1. Setup Git User Credentials: I configured my global email and name for Git, which are used when connecting with GitHub.

2. Created a New Git Repository: I initialized a new Git repository in the "lab-02" folder and verified the installation.

3. Added an Initial JavaScript File: I copied the JavaScript file from Lab 1 into the "lab-02" folder, renamed it to "lab-02-node.js," and updated the documentation block.

4. Added the File to Git: I used Git commands to add the "lab-02-node.js" file to the repository, track changes, and commit the file with an appropriate message.

5. Ignored Files: I learned how to ignore files using a ".gitignore" file. I created an "ignored.txt" file and added it to the ignore list by modifying the ".gitignore" file.

6. Used "git status" and "git diff": I used the "git status" command to check the status of files and the "git diff" command to view the differences between tracked files.

7. Used Wildcards: I employed the wildcard specifier ("*.js") to stage multiple files for committing.

8. Cloned a Cloud Repo: I cloned a GitHub repository, "Hangman-Game," to my local computer using the appropriate HTTPS URL.

9. Explored Branches: I learned about Git branches and used the "git branch" command to list available branches and identify the current branch ("master").

10. Determined Repo Files: I used the "git ls-files" command to list the tracked files in the repository and saved the listing to a file called "lab-02-files.txt."

Key Takeaways:

- The importance of initializing a Git repository to track changes in software development.
- The process of adding, committing, and tracking files within a Git repository.
- Understanding the use of a ".gitignore" file to exclude certain files from being tracked.
- Using "git status" to check the status of files and "git diff" to view changes.
- Leveraging wildcards to stage multiple files for committing.
- The ability to clone remote repositories to local machines for collaboration.
- The concept of branching for isolated development and eventual merging.
- Using "git ls-files" to determine the tracked files within a repository.
- Overall, this lab provided hands-on experience with Git commands, file management, and repository setup, laying the foundation for efficient version control and collaborative software development.
